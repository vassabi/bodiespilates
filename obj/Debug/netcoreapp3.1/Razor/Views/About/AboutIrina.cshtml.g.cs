            <h2>About Irina</h2>
            <p>
                I’m Irina, the head instructor at Bodies Pilates. At 16, I came to the US from Armenia to attend university. After graduation, I wanted a career in fashion, but after chronic back pain and significant fusion surgeries, my plans changed.
            </p>
            <p>I discovered Pilates as a method of coping with my own physical pain after surgery. I found that I was able to connect to my body more clearly and understand how the correct movement helped me recover. The technical elements of the body’s mechanics ");
            WriteLiteral(@"and proper postural alignment are something to master, and I began to chase excellence. </p>
            <p>I learned how the body could heal itself when we treat it with love and respect. Pilates is one way I can tune into what my body needs. I love helping others find this connection themselves, even after they have tried exercising in the past - even corrective exercising - and they’ve found it hasn’t helped them.</p>
            <p>By taking the time to get to know my clients and building relationships over the long term, which are based on honest communication and profound and sincere care for their well-being, I’m able to help them achieve the results they want. Once we find the right way to be consistent, they can affect real, sustainable change - even from chronic pain.</p>
